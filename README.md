## Overview

- Create AI-generated playlist covers based on song content (such as lyrics) and Spotify track audio feature metadata values. 

## Project Improvement Goals

- Actually map different genres and ranges of key spotify values to moods, shapes, colors, etc.

- Have generative text AI like chatGPT generate the prompt for Dall-E s.t. the prompt can be more varied and expressive

- Implement easy share functionality s.t. the generated image can be shared to social media with key information on how it was generated

- Do code to token exchange on backend

- Move backend to Azure Function App and Frontend to blob static hosting

- Far off goal: add support for apple music
